# can-i-drink-a-redbull

The dragonfruit flavored RedBull is a delightful, sweet, earthy, and somewhat sour drink that debuted in 2021 as the seasonal Summer Edition flavor. After initial success, the dragonfruit flavor was quickly made the new Green Edition RedBull, replacing the far less popular kiwi apple Green Edition. 

Since I first tasted this delightful drink, I have wanted nothing more than to continue drinking it. It is such a unique flavor profile, a satisfying acquired taste, and filled with a small amount of caffeine perfect for starting my day. I have frequently purchased it by the 24-pack case from food supply stores since it hit the shelves. I am certain I have drank hundreds of cans of it.

Recently, I have found out that RedBull will be replacing the dragonfruit flavor with a new Green Edition, curuba or elderflower, the 2024 Summer Edition flavor. While I enjoy this flavor, it is not better than the dragonfruit, and there is no reason why consumers should not be able to purchase both flavors.

To say I am distraught is an understatement. I was still working through several cases of the dragonfruit RedBull when they stopped production, so it was a long time before I noticed it dissapearing from shelves and found out the bad news. Since then, I have gone through great lengths to acquire some of the last of this great flavor (not an easy task, due to its popularity). This site is intended to help me ration through my supply at a reasonable pace, as to hopefully sustain myself until RedBull comes to its senses and reinstates the wonderful dragonfruit flavor.
